p = m * v,Linear momentum is the product of |a system's mass and its velocity.|You can see from the equation that |momentum is directly proportional |to the objectâ€™s mass (m) |and velocity (v). |Therefore, the greater an |object's mass or the greater |its velocity, the greater its momentum. |A large, fast-moving object |has greater momentum than |a smaller, slower object.
